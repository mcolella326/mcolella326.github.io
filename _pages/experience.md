# Simpson Gumpertz & Heger
*August 2019 - Present*
- Specialized in thermal and fluid simulations of complex mechanical systems, leading design and analysis efforts across large‐scale infrastructure projects valued at $15M+
- Managed cross‐functional teams of up to 6 engineers across mechanical, structural, and architectural disciplines, completing work ahead of schedule and under budget
- Authored 30+ technical proposals, incorporating detailed internal budgets, project phasing schedules, and comprehensive task plans for diverse engineering services and securing over $2M in awarded contracts annually

## Notable Projects

- **Fusion Reactor Cooling System Design and Assessment**
    - Conducted 3D STAR-CCM+ simulations of coolant channels under EM heating, identifying thermal hotspots and improving steady/transient performance
    - Proposed flow re-routing strategy that improved heat transfer efficiency by 35%, enhancing thermal margin across the channel geometry
    - Automated parametric simulations with Java-based scripting, improving analysis turnaround time by 200% and enabling rapid sensitivity studies

- **Fission Reactor Seismic Loading Assessment**
    - Simulated two-phase flow behavior during seismic disturbances using STAR-CCM+ to validate compliance with ASME and NRC thermal safety criteria
    - Achieved 15% flow rate gain by redesigning piping layout, improving cooling capacity during peak seismic loads

- **Airport Parking Garage Natural Ventilation Design and Assessment**
    - Designed a natural ventilation system using STAR‐CCM+ simulations that eliminated the need for mechanical HVAC systems, saving $5M in project costs while maintaining air quality standards
    - Executed transient 3D CFD simulations during peak traffic hours to size inlet openings, decreasing peak pollutant concentration by 40% over baseline design

- **Large-Scale Museum Condensation Risk and Occupant Comfort Assessment**
    - Evaluated 18,000 sq. ft. internal environment for condensation and thermal comfort using detailed air movement and moisture load modeling
    - Reduced glazing condensation risk by 68% through air supply optimization and stratification mitigation

- **Residential Condensation Risk Assessment**
    - Conducted 3D steady-state thermal simulation using ANSYS for 96,000 sq. ft. residential structure to identify high-risk surfaces
    - Reduced condensation exposure from baseline to 35 nonconsecutive hours/year through convection coefficient sensitivity analysis and roofing buildup redesign
