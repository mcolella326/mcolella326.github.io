## Notable Projects

- **Fusion Reactor Cooling System Design and Assessment**
    - Sized reactor coolant channels to maximize heat transfer efficacy while mitigating buoyancy-driven flow instability effects, increasing the average convective heat transfer coefficient by 75% relative to the base design
    - Assessed the efficacy of the cooling system under normal operating and hotspot conditions using transient simulations in StarCCM+, ensuring optimal performance of all channels
    - Created graphical representations of pressure, mass flow rate, and temperature to justify design decisions in monthly meetings with the design team

- **Fission Reactor Seismic Loading Assessment**
    - Analyzed coolant flow behavior under seismic loading conditions using a VOF transient simulation in StarCCM+, comparing coolant sloshing height to local safety regulations
    - Characterized proper coolant flow rate through the reactor using a provided pump curve and a submodel-derived system curve
    - Proposed design solutions to mitigate sloshing based on simulation results and discussions with the design team

- **Airport Parking Garage Natural Ventilation Design and Assessment**
    - Developed a comprehensive CFD model using StarCCM+ to evaluate the necessity of an HVAC system in a 6-story parking garage, confirming that natural ventilation is sufficient to maintain vehicular CO emissions within acceptable EPA limits and leading to an 80% reduction in overall design costs
    - Evaluated total vehicular CO emissions levels considering factors such as average vehicle speed, projected number of electric vehicles, impact of reformulated gasoline, and expected vehicle starts per hour
    - Collected publicly available DMV registration records to extrapolate the number of electric vehicles, using Python to fit 20 years of data to logistic curves
    - Aggregated local wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and relative humidity data to obtain average seasonal weather conditions over 10 years using Python
    - Ran 3D transient simulations over peak traffic hours to optimize the inlet area needed for natural ventilation, improving ventilation design efficacy by 40% relative to the base design

- **Large-Scale Museum Condensation Risk and Occupant Comfort Assessment**
    - Assessed condensation risk on interior glazing and evaluated occupant comfort in a new 18,000 square foot museum under worst-case heating and cooling conditions
    - Optimized air supply placement and throw in sensitive regions to mitigate air stratification and minimize glazing condensation, reducing condensation risk by 68% relative to the base design
    - Modeled internal air spaces, internal heat generation, air supplies and returns, fenestration components, occupant heat and moisture loads, lighting heat loads, and solar heat loads with steady-state simulations in StarCCM+, generating graphical representations of temperature, relative humidity, flow streamlines, and glazing surfaces with a high risk of condensation
    - Provided consulting advice and design assistance to the design team on HVAC strategies to reduce condensation risk and maintain occupant comfort while meeting space setpoint requirements

- **Large-Scale Residential Condensation Risk Assessment**
    - Conducted a condensation risk assessment using ANSYS Workbench for a new 96,000 square foot residential building
    - Created a 3D steady-state thermal model considering night sky radiation, local ASHRAE design temperatures, and exterior wind speeds
    - Performed an interior convection coefficient sensitivity study and advised the design team on HVAC strategies to mitigate condensation potential, reducing condensation potential to 35 nonconsecutive hours per year
