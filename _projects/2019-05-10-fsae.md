# Background

The Cooper Union FSAE team (Cooper Motorsports) is a team of approximately 20 dedicated to designing, manufacturing, and testing a racecar for the yearly Formula SAE competition. Each year, the team leaders would subdivide the team into groups working on each vehicle subsystem.

From 2016 through 2019, I was the leader of the frame subsystem. I was in charge of designing a frame to meet structural rigidity, ergonomic, subsystem packaging, manufacturability, and time constraints each year. I manufactured frame welding jigs and suspension mounting tabs, and notched prepurchased tubes in preparation for welding in Cooper Union's machine shop. I managed a team of junior engineers throughout the design process to ensure timely completion of all design objectives.

# Design Concept and Objectives

We consistently used a 4130 chromoly steel space frame as a design concept. The steel alloy was chosen for its high strength to weight ratio, its high toughness, its weldability, and its heat treatability. A space frame was chosen for its efficient strength to weight ratio, its modular design allowing for easy modifications without affecting the overall structure, and its ability to distribute weight by strategically placing more steel tubing closer to the desired center of gravity location.

For each year I led the subsystem, the frame of the car needed to hold all vehicle components in their desired locations while resisting loads applied by the suspension, engine, and aerodynamic systems. Previous frame designs proved to be too stiff, used too many tubes in areas that did not transmit enough force, did not allow for easy ingress/egress, and did not utilize the full potential of the aerodynamics package. The frame design plan was balanced among 7 priorities:

- Knowledge of how tube forces are distributed throughout the frame when braking, accelerating, and cornering.
- Maintenance of a low center of gravity with a slight rear-heavy weight distribution.
- Maintenance of a high torsional rigidity (at least a full order of magnitude above the designed difference in roll rates).
- Minimization of vehicle weight.
- Easy driver accessibility (easy driver ingress/egress, ensuring each intended driver can reach pedals and see over the front roll hoop, providing sufficient room to turn the steering wheel, etc.).
-  Manufacturability (ease of welding, ensuring no difficult to access locations on the vehicle for maintenance, etc.).
- Packaging (ensuring each subsystem has ample room to allow for design modifications).

# Design Implementation

To ensure each of the design objectives were met, my team and I would conduct weekly meetings with drivers for the year and other subsystem leads to preliminarily gauge how much space each subsystem needed to place their designed component on the car. We constructed a rough simulacrum of the frame front bulkhead and cockpit using PVC tubing to gauge driver ergonomics. Finally, we simulated the frame behavior under braking, accelerating, and cornering conditions using ANSYS Mechanical APDL and recorded the resulting frame deflection and forces through each frame member; we placed tubes to maximize torsional rigidity while minimizing overall frame weight.

The FSAE competition ranks approximately 120 student teams based on design, cost, and racing performance. Our dedication to consistent communication and good engineering design practices consistently placed us in the top 20 teams. Our highest ever chassis design score was 22/25 in 2019, helping our team to tie for 8th place in overall design.
